And i know i could be more creative
come up with poetic lines

But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
is the only thing that's on my mind
you take me higher, higher than i've ever been babe
just come over, let's pour a drink babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late
you light my fire

Red yellow blue green. Youre welcome
